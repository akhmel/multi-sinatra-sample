Multi Class Sinatra Sample Application
======================================

This is a simple application showing how you can mount multiple Sinatra applications into a single process.  It utilizes the builtin Rack middleware, URLMap.  I use a simple RackUp file to launch the server, though you can probably do this in a single file.

thin -R config.ru start

or 

rake start

I've extended this example to show how with a shared base class between 'apps' you can easily share configuration options. 

This sample now includes a sample set of RSpec tests using Sinatra's new recommended test method, Rack::Test.  I've also fixed a few issues bringing it up to compatibility with Sinatra 0.9.3
